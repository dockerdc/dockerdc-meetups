# dockerdc-meetups

Hi! You can find our meetup group here: http://www.meetup.com/docker-dc

Group and interest have really expanded, so @ramezjm and @schvin
thought it would be a good idea to try and organize a relatively
set pattern for the meetups.

Wanted to use this repository to collect talk ideas, scheduling
ideas, or other collaborative efforts around Docker DC. Pleaes feel
free to submit pull requests or send us a note if you'd like to
join the team.

Proposed goals for routine meetings:

* every 2 months, semi-consistent weekday & location
* aim to not overlap with other routine meetups that have overlap interest groups
 * OpenStack DC
 * AWS group
 * DevOps DC
 * etc
